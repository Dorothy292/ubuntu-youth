                    Mentorship and life coaching are two distinct yet complementary approaches
                     to personal and professional development. A mentor is an experienced individual who provides guidance,
                      inspiration, and support, often sharing their wisdom and insights based on their personal experiences. 
                      They help set and achieve personal and professional goals, offer encouragement, and provide reassurance during challenging times.
